## Project Overview

The project consists of a central Python program that handles all logic and data, and an interface that can be called from diverse modules in order to be available on multiple platforms. For example, Escordia can be used as a Discord Bot or a Flask API.

Escordia stores static data such as enemies, items, and more on CSV files, while dynamic data such as players, inventories, and more is stored in a database using Peewee.

## Usage

Please note that Escordia is still a work in progress and is not available for use right now. Stay tuned for updates on the project's availability.
