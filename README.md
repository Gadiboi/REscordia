# Escordia - Open RPG System

Escordia is a free and open RPG system made from scratch and built with Python. The project was originally based on a Discord bot programmed in 2021/2022 and aims to provide an open system to build RPG Discord Bots with Python.

## Project Overview

Escordia is currently capable of:
- Creating and keeping track of RPG characters made by users. These characters have their own stats, inventory, job, skills, etc.
- Managing concurrent battles and dungeons.
- Divide a map in areas, each area having different enemies, items and dungeons.
- Managing a ton of items with different stat alterations that characters can equip.
- Managing skills that both player and enemies can use in combat.
- Having a complex job system in which each job has its own skills, preferred weapons, experience, level and requisites.
- In-game shops that vary depending on the character's current area.
- Destroying user's items at choice in order to exchange them for permanent stat upgrades.
- Managing buffs and debuffs while in combat.
- Managing an element system in skills in order to strike enemies' weaknesses/resistances. 
- Define a vast amount of custom data (items, enemies, skills, classes) in a simple JSON.

Escordia stores static data such as enemies, items, and more on JSON files, while dynamic data such as players, inventories, and more is stored in a database using Peewee.
